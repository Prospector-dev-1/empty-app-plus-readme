# @fishtank/shared-ui

Shared React UI components used across all Fishtank applications.

## Usage

```typescript
import { Button, Card } from '@fishtank/shared-ui';
```

## Purpose

This package contains reusable UI components that are used across multiple apps.
As you identify common patterns, extract them here to reduce duplication.

## Guidelines

- Components should be generic and configurable
- Follow the same design system as the main apps
- Include proper TypeScript types
- Document props and usage examples
