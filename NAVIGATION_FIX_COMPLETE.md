# Navigation Fix Complete ✅

## Problem
All navigation buttons in the Creator and Investor apps were redirecting to the onboarding page instead of navigating within their respective role UIs.

## Root Cause
The navigation components were using relative paths (e.g., `/`, `/discover`, `/profile`) instead of absolute paths that included the role prefix (e.g., `/creator`, `/creator/discover`, `/creator/profile`).

Since the app structure uses role-based routing (`/creator/*`, `/investor/*`, `/innovator/*`), the navigation links needed to include the role prefix in their paths.

## Changes Made

### 1. Creator BottomNav (`src/components/creator/BottomNav.tsx`)
**Before:**
```typescript
const navItems = [
  { path: "/", icon: Home, label: "Home" },
  { path: "/discover", icon: Briefcase, label: "Discover" },
  { path: "/network", icon: Users, label: "Network" },
  { path: "/inbox", icon: MessageCircle, label: "Inbox" },
  { path: "/profile", icon: User, label: "Profile" },
];
```

**After:**
```typescript
const navItems = [
  { path: "/creator", icon: Home, label: "Home" },
  { path: "/creator/discover", icon: Briefcase, label: "Discover" },
  { path: "/creator/network", icon: Users, label: "Network" },
  { path: "/creator/inbox", icon: MessageCircle, label: "Inbox" },
  { path: "/creator/profile", icon: User, label: "Profile" },
];
```

Also updated the `end` prop check from `path === "/"` to `path === "/creator"`.

### 2. Investor BottomNav (`src/components/investor/BottomNav.tsx`)
**Before:**
```typescript
const navItems = [
  { icon: Home, label: 'Home', path: '/dashboard' },
  { icon: TrendingUp, label: 'Tank', path: '/discover' },
  { icon: MessageCircle, label: 'Messages', path: '/messages' },
  { icon: User, label: 'Profile', path: '/profile' },
];
```

**After:**
```typescript
const navItems = [
  { icon: Home, label: 'Home', path: '/investor/dashboard' },
  { icon: TrendingUp, label: 'Tank', path: '/investor/discover' },
  { icon: MessageCircle, label: 'Messages', path: '/investor/messages' },
  { icon: User, label: 'Profile', path: '/investor/profile' },
];
```

### 3. Innovator Navigation (`src/components/innovator/layout/FishtankNavigation.tsx`)
**Status:** No changes needed ✅

The Innovator navigation was already correctly implemented with role-prefixed paths:
```typescript
const navItems = [
  { path: "/innovator", icon: Home, label: "Home" },
  { path: "/innovator/tank", icon: Rocket, label: "Tank" },
  { path: "/innovator/network", icon: Users, label: "Network" },
  { path: "/innovator/collaborate", icon: Lightbulb, label: "Collaborate" },
  { path: "/innovator/messaging", icon: MessageCircle, label: "Messages", badge: pendingRequestsCount },
];
```

## Testing Results ✅

All navigation flows tested and working:
- **Creator:** Home → Discover → Network (all working)
- **Investor:** Home → Tank → Messages (all working)
- **Innovator:** Home → Tank → Network (all working)

## Key Takeaway
In a unified React Router app with nested routes, navigation links must use absolute paths that include the full route prefix, not relative paths from the root.
