# Backend Removed

**Date**: October 12, 2025  
**Branch**: `chore/purge-backend`

## Overview

All backend, cloud, and database functionality has been completely removed from this codebase. The project now runs as a **purely client-side UI** with local mock data only.

## What Was Removed

### Backend Services
- ✅ All Supabase integration code, migrations, and configuration
- ✅ Authentication services (signup/signin/session management)
- ✅ Database queries and ORM code
- ✅ Environment variables and secrets (.env files)
- ✅ Analytics and telemetry code

### Folders Deleted
- `src/roles/creator/supabase/` (migrations and config)
- `src/roles/innovator/supabase/` (migrations and config)
- `src/lib/supabaseClient.ts`
- `.env.example`, `src/roles/creator/.env`, `src/roles/innovator/.env`

### Dependencies Removed
- `@supabase/supabase-js` (from all package.json files)

## What Was Added

### Mock Data Layer
The UI now uses a local mock layer located in:
- **`src/mocks/data/users.json`** - Mock user data
- **`src/mocks/data/startups.json`** - Mock startup data
- **`src/mocks/api.ts`** - Mock API functions with simulated delays

### Mock Supabase Clients
- `src/roles/creator/src/integrations/supabase/client.ts` - No-op mock
- `src/roles/innovator/src/integrations/supabase/client.ts` - No-op mock
- Both return successful responses without making network calls

## Current Architecture

### Unified Landing Page
- **URL**: http://localhost:5173/onboarding
- Beautiful Fishtank-branded role selection page
- Routes users to independent role apps

### Independent Role Apps
1. **Creator App** - Port 5174
2. **Innovator App** - Port 5175  
3. **Investor App** - Port 5176

Each app runs independently with its own configuration and dependencies.

## How to Run

```bash
# Root unified landing page
npm run dev
# Runs on http://localhost:5173

# Independent role apps (in separate terminals)
cd src/roles/creator && npm run dev -- --port 5174
cd src/roles/innovator && npm run dev -- --port 5175
cd src/roles/investor && npm run dev -- --port 5176
```

## Future Considerations

When you're ready to add backend functionality again:
1. Replace mock API calls in `src/mocks/api.ts` with real endpoints
2. Add back environment variables for API keys
3. Reinstall backend SDKs (@supabase/supabase-js, etc.)
4. Update the Supabase client files to use real configuration
5. Add back authentication flows

## Build Status

✅ **Type check passes** (`npm run typecheck`)  
✅ **Production build succeeds** (`npm run build`)  
✅ **All apps run locally** with mock data  
✅ **Zero network calls** - completely offline-capable  

---

**Note**: This is a deliberate architectural decision to enable pure front-end development without backend dependencies. The UI is fully functional with mock data and can demonstrate all user flows.
