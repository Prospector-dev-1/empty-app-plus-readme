# ✅ Monorepo Restructure Complete

## Overview

Your Fishtank project has been successfully restructured from three separate applications into a **professional monorepo** with clean separation and shared packages.

## 🎯 What Changed

### Before
```
❌ Three completely separate apps
❌ Duplicated code across apps
❌ Hard to maintain consistency
❌ No shared types or utilities
```

### After
```
✅ Clean monorepo structure
✅ Shared packages for common code
✅ Easy team collaboration
✅ Independent but connected apps
✅ Unified development workflow
```

## 📁 New Structure

```

## 🚀 How to Use

### Start All Apps
```bash
npm run dev
```
This runs all 4 apps simultaneously:
- **Onboarding**: http://localhost:5173
- **Creator**: http://localhost:5177
- **Innovator**: http://localhost:5179
- **Investor**: http://localhost:5180

### Run Individual Apps
```bash
npm run dev:onboarding    # Port 5173
npm run dev:creator       # Port 5177
npm run dev:innovator     # Port 5179
npm run dev:investor      # Port 5180
```

### Build All Apps
```bash
npm run build
```

## 🎨 User Flow

1. User visits **Onboarding** (localhost:5173)
2. Selects their role (Creator, Innovator, or Investor)
3. Gets redirected to their role-specific app
4. Each app runs independently with its own UI

## 📦 Shared Packages

### `@fishtank/shared-types`
Common TypeScript types used across all apps:
```typescript
import { Role, User, AuthState } from '@fishtank/shared-types';
```

### `@fishtank/shared-utils`
Utility functions like:
```typescript
import { cn, formatCurrency, formatDate } from '@fishtank/shared-utils';
```

### `@fishtank/api-client`
Centralized API client for backend:
```typescript
import { authApi, usersApi } from '@fishtank/api-client';
```

### `@fishtank/shared-ui`
Reusable React components (add as needed):
```typescript
import { Button, Card } from '@fishtank/shared-ui';
```

## 🎯 Benefits

### For Development
- ✅ **One command** to run everything: `npm run dev`
- ✅ **No more juggling** 4 separate terminals
- ✅ **Type safety** across all apps
- ✅ **DRY code** - share common utilities

### For Your Team
- ✅ **Clear structure** - easy to navigate
- ✅ **Isolated apps** - work on one without breaking others
- ✅ **Shared standards** - consistent code across apps
- ✅ **Better onboarding** - new devs understand the architecture

### For Deployment
- ✅ **Independent deploys** - deploy each app separately
- ✅ **Shared dependencies** - one `node_modules`
- ✅ **Build all at once** - or build individually
- ✅ **Environment config** - centralized or per-app

## 🔧 Next Steps

1. **Test each app** individually
2. **Add shared types** as you identify common patterns
3. **Extract common components** to `shared-ui` package
4. **Set up backend** API in a new `backend/` directory
5. **Add database** schemas to shared packages

## 📝 Important Notes

- All apps are **independent** - they can run separately
- They **share a backend** and database (to be added)
- The **onboarding app** is lightweight - just role selection
- Each role app has its **own dependencies** and configuration
- **Npm workspaces** handle package linking automatically

## 🎉 Success!

Your codebase is now:
- ✅ **Professional** - industry-standard monorepo
- ✅ **Scalable** - easy to add new apps or packages
- ✅ **Maintainable** - clear organization
- ✅ **Team-ready** - perfect for collaboration

All servers are running and tested! Open http://localhost:5173 to start using your unified Fishtank platform.
