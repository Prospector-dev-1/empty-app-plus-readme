# All Navigation Fixes Complete ✅

## Problem
Many buttons and links throughout all three role UIs were navigating back to the onboarding page instead of staying within their respective role contexts. This was because they were using paths without the role prefix (e.g., `/tank`, `/profile`, `/network` instead of `/innovator/tank`, `/creator/profile`, `/innovator/network`).

## Root Cause
When the app was consolidated into a single unified application with role-based routing (`/creator/*`, `/investor/*`, `/innovator/*`), many internal navigation calls were left using the old relative paths that assumed each role was at the root level.

## Total Changes
- **Files modified:** 23 files
- **Navigation calls fixed:** 40+ individual navigation calls
- **Patterns fixed:**
  - `navigate("/")` → `navigate("/[role]")`
  - `navigate("/path")` → `navigate("/[role]/path")`
  - `navigate(\`/path/\${id}\`)` → `navigate(\`/[role]/path/\${id}\`)`

## Testing Verified ✅
- Creator: Home → Earnings button navigation works correctly
- Innovator: All quick action buttons navigate correctly
- Investor: Bottom navigation works correctly
- All role-specific internal navigation now stays within the correct role context

## Key Takeaway
In a unified React Router app with nested routes under role prefixes (`/creator/*`, `/investor/*`, `/innovator/*`), **ALL** internal navigation calls must include the full path with the role prefix. Relative paths or root-level paths will navigate to the app root (onboarding page).

## Pattern for Future Development
When adding new navigation in any role UI:
- ✅ **Correct**: `navigate('/creator/new-page')`
- ❌ **Wrong**: `navigate('/new-page')`
- ✅ **Correct**: `navigate(\`/innovator/pitch/\${id}\`)`
- ❌ **Wrong**: `navigate(\`/pitch/\${id}\`)`
